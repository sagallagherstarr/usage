usage - a SUSHI and COUNTER usage statistics app

The basic idea -

Libraries can gather some usage statistics on electronic resources (ebooks, journals,
videos, etc.) from vendors, who provide these statistics in formats that fall under
the name COUNTER. Statistics from most vendors can be gathered using SUSHI as the 
protocol.

This app will:
- Hold details on each vendor's SUSHI access information
- Collect usage data from each vendor when prompted using
  COUNTER releases 4, 5 and beyond
- Store gathered usage data
- Display usage data in useful formats
- Export usage data to common spreadsheet formats
- provide useful feedback around errors
- Have a GUI to carry out these functions
